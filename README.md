## Where is the source code?

After 100 commits I decided to close source the source code of the repository. There was no incentive to keep the game open source with all the legal troubles it would have caused, esp. considering that the assets were licensed content, meaning that nobody but me was able to make changes to the game either way.

I love open source but this is the first time that open source wasn't the way to go, I hope you understand :)
